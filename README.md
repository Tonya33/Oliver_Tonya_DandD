# CRUSH INSECTS
===================================

This project is a "crushing bugs" assignment. I have tried to figure out how to append the children elements of the drop zone to the drag zone. I am also trying to figure out how to only allow the correct elements to enter the drop zone. Although I haven't figured out the correct function, I look forward to knowing the answer.
